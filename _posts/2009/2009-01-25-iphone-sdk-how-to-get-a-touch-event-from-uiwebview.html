<p>・Over view<br />
UIScroller is a subview of UIWebView. UIWebDocumentView is a subview of UIScroller.<br />
Unfortunately, these classes are private and undocumented. And we have to peek a touch event from this UIWebDocumentView. However, we can't use these classes via Apple SDK and find any information from documents with SDK.<br />
You can't peek any click events to UIWebView because touchesXXXX:withEvent: method, private class UIWebDocumentview's method, can't be overrided.<br />
Therefore, we peek touch event to UIWebDocumentView by replacing instance method with method-swizzling.<br />
・method swizzling<br />
Method swizzling enables to replace instance method with the other one very easily. You can do that with the methods in "objc/objc-runtime.h". Detail of method swizzling is illustrated <a href="http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?MethodSwizzling">here</a>.<br />
・UICWebView</p>
<pre>
@implementation UIView (__TapHook)
- (void)__replacedTouchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event {
[self __replacedTouchesBegan:touches withEvent:event];
if( [self.superview.superview isMemberOfClass:[UICWebView class]] ) {
[(UICWebView*)self.superview.superview hookedTouchesBegan:touches withEvent:event];
}
}
@end
+ (void)installHook {
Class klass = objc_getClass( "UIWebDocumentView" );
// replace touch began event
method_exchangeImplementations(
class_getInstanceMethod(klass, @selector(touchesBegan:withEvent:)),
class_getInstanceMethod(klass, @selector(__replacedTouchesBegan:withEvent:)) );
}
</pre>
<p>By this code, when an instance of UIWebDocumentView is called "touchesBegan:withEvent:", "__replacedTouchesBegan:withEvent:" is called instead of it.<br />
And, when "__replacedTouchesBegan:withEvent:" called, "touchesBegan:withEvent:" is called.<br />
Above, when UICWebView is clicked, "hookedTouchesBegan:withEvent" is called. You can do something on "hookedTouchesBegan:withEvent" when UIWebView clicked.<br />

Thank you for helping me to write a nice code, @Psychs, @norio.</p>
