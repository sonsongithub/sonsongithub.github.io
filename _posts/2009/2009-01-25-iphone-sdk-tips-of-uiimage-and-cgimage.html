<p>Some greate UIImage, CGImage APIs are provided to manage and use image.<br />
<b>How to Expand UIImage for variable width buttons</b><br />
It looks too bad, that an image is expanded directly when it is set to UIBotton, UIImageView and so on.<br />
If you make it look so good, you don't have to directly expand image. If you use following API,  when you scale or resize image, 4 corner area that you specify are are not scaled or resized. 2 arguments are corner areas' width and height.</p>
<pre>
UIImage *stretched = [original stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:5 topCapHeight:5];
</pre>
<p><b>Resize UIImage</b><br />
Use this API, very simply. But this method is private and undocumented, you can't use this method for application to submit AppStore.</p>
<pre>
UIImage *resized = [image _imageScaledToSize:CGSizeMake( new_width, new_height ) interpolationQuality:quality];
</pre>
<p><b>Crop CGImage</b><br />
You can crop the image with following API.</p>
<pre>
CGImageRef clipped = CGImageCreateWithImageInRect ( image, rectROI );
</pre>
<p>This API makes subimage from original CGImage. This API retains original image, doesn't alloc new CGImage.</p>
