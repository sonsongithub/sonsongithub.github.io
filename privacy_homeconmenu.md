HomeConeMenu's source code is published at [github.com](https://github.com/sonsongithub/HomeConMenu).

HomeConMenu DOES not collect any of your personal data. HomeConMenu can save your preference settings(for example, your favorite UI color) of it.
Let me know if you have some questions about the policy.

Thank you.
